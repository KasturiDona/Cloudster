Overview




Description
IBM Tivoli Storage Manager as a Service is the Data Protection solution that gives all sizes of businesses an enterprise-grade platform that helps cost-effectively meet the demanding backup, disaster recovery and business continuity requirements.

Protect almost any server platform using highly configurable backup profiles, create unlimited archives and if required, create “Bare- Metal Recoveries”to physical or virtual machines.

Organisations are using and storing more data than ever before. Data volumes are growing exponentially, and government regulations and competitive pressures are increasing –forcing the retention of more data for longer periods of time.  A cost effective, off-site solution is now required.

* 100% Set-and-Forget 
* 100% Meet all your Data Protection needs 
* 0% Zero hardware investments

IBM Tivoli Storage Manager (CTSM) is a centralised, policy-based, enterprise class, data protection and recovery solution. The service is quick to install and deploy using Cloudster’s control panel and our preconfigured clients. Your protected data is always available for fast and easy recovery. Each backup job will be run automatically after being configured according to your needs and, with incremental backup and server size de-duplication you reduce bandwidth and storage space and improve recovery times. Critical systems and databases are protected whilst online, maintaining normal operations.
