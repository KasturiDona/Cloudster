	<h4>Description</h4>
	<p>Even a single malware infection can bring your operations to a grinding halt. Without the additional protection layers offered by a dedicated anti-virus solution, malware can result in the contamination of the whole corporate network.</p>
	<p>Protection Service for Business (PSB) powered by F-Secure offers complete and comprehensive protection for the whole IT environment: desktops, laptops, mobile devices, as well as email and file servers.</p>
	<p>Protection Service is a hosted, comprehensive turn-key protection suite for multi- device environments. It offers the best security on the market, coupled with advanced value-added features such as Software Updater, and ensures worry-free state-of-the-art protection for your business.</p>
	<p>PSB provides real-time protection against viruses, spyware, spam, intrusion attempts and web-based attacks. F-Secure’s licensing policy is the most flexible in the industry: you can choose either monthly or yearly billing for the service.</p>
	<p>Keeping software up to date is a critical part of computer and business security. (60% of top ten malware could have been avoided by using up-to-date software).</p>
	<p>PSB Workstation Security for Windows includes Software Updater, which scans the computers for missing software updates. It keeps the operating system and 3rd party applications up to date and patched against vulnerabilities.</p>
	<p>For you as a customer, PSB is an essential part of your corporate security policy and an important tool in protecting business-critical operations. It offers lower implementation costs, high-quality virus detection, and easy central management via the web-based Portal.</p>
